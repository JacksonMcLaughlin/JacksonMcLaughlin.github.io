I am a second-year Mechanical Engineering Student at Cal Poly in San Luis Opispo, California.
This school teaches  by a "Learn by Doing" philosophy, so I am getting hands-on practice
with skills like CAD, machining, and welding. I have also gotten experience working for
[Armabot](https://armabot.com), a supplier of kits for the educational
[FIRST Robotics competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) in my summer breaks.
There I worked closely with my mentor, the owner/operator of the company, on product design,
manufacturing and documentation, as well as organization of inventory and purchases.
