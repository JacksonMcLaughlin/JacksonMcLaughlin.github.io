## Armabot
I worked for [Armabot](https://www.armabot.com/) in the summers
of 2018 and 2019 as an intern. The owner/operator of the company has been
a mentor to me. My tasks were varied, including:
* Creation of print assembly instructions and outline drawings
* Product Design
* Inventory and purchase management
* Product Manufacturing (Manual Machining, CNC operation)
* Filming and editing of instructional videos

The complete portfolio of my Armabot work can be found [here](/armabot/)

## Writing Samples
[Topology Optimization Translation Report](/assets/pdf/translationreport.pdf)  
This report gives an overview of the process of topology optimization for a
non-technical user. It was written for my Technical Writing class. The
objective of the assignment was to develop skills in making complex content
clear.

[Strain Gauge Calibration Memo](/assets/pdf/strainmemo.pdf)  
This memo describes the results my lab group got using a strain gauge with
a cantilever beam to form a load cell. Known masses were used to define a
calibration curve, and then unknown masses were determined using the cell.

## Projects
### Formula SAE Pit Cart
This project, still in progress, was to make a cart to hold tools and
spare tires for the Formula SAE team at competition. The cart was
designed using the Weldments features of SOLIDWORKS. Working with
an older student, I learned the necesarry skills to TIG weld the
frame together.
